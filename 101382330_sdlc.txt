Programming errors is one of the leading reasons why a deployment fails.
 The frequent release of code occasioned with the DevOps approach ensures problem detection at an earlier stage. With dev and ops teams working together, recovery time is a lot shorter.

 The DevOps process builds quality into the development process, thereby reducing instances of unplanned work. A focus on security during the designing and development stage minimizes the need to remedy security issues later on, thus saving time and freeing more resources to other work.
  Besides, every member of the team is responsible for quality and security; this collective responsibility ensures team accountability for the final product.

  Though your salary will depend on your role, the average pay for the different roles is not radically different. For instance, a DevOps Release Manager earns an average of $92K, a Site Reliability Engineer $125K, and a DevOps Engineer $115K.
