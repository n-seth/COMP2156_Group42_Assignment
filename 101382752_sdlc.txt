DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.
The learning of DevOps helps in reducing the time for cycles of development and also ensures a faster rate of innovation. If the operations and development teams are in different silos then obviously it will be a hard task to identify whether the application is ready for operation or not.

A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates. Maybe you want to shift your career to DevOps, or train yourself to drive adoption within your company.
